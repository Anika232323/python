He causes mischief every day and is constantly being scolded by his teacher, Iruka Umino. He has fallen so far behind in his studies that his graduation is uncertain, but Naruto actually dreams of becoming the leader of the village, known as the Hokage, and vows to one day become the No. 1 ninja.
However, all the adults in the village treat Naruto with disdain due to a secret surrounding his birth. 12 years ago, when Naruto was just a baby, the Nine-Tailed Fox attacked the village, and the only way to stop it was to seal it inside of him. This fact is first revealed to him by Mizuki, an instructor at the academy who uses Naruto to steal the Scroll of Sealing from the current Hokage. Once the deed is done, he appears before the young ninja and discloses the shocking truth behind his birth. Naruto manages to defeat Mizuki with Iruka’s help, who despite knowing about Naruto’s past, has always believed in him. After learning Iruka’s true feelings, Naruto gains a renewed determination to pursue his dream.
After successfully graduating from the academy alongside fellow students Sasuke Uchiha and Sakura Haruno, Naruto finally takes the first steps on his journey as a real ninja!<a href=https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Naruto_Uzumaki><br>Click here to know more about Naruto Uzumaki</h3></a></label>

He is a member of Team 7, alongside Naruto Uzumaki, Sakura Haruno, and their leader and former mentor, Kakashi Hatake. After the end of the original series, he marries Sakura, and becomes the father of Sarada Uchiha and the son-in-law of Kizashi Haruno and Mebuki Haruno.
After Naruto and Hinata got sealed in the Daikokuten by Kawaki and Ada's Omnipotence struck the Shinobi World, Sasuke protects his student Boruto Uzumaki, who was framed of a crime he didn't commit, and helps him get stronger as a way to help Boruto get his life back and stop Kawaki, before he sacrificed himself to protect Boruto from Code and his Claw Mark clone army.
He is voiced by Noriaki Sugiyama in the Japanese version of the anime, and by Yuri Lowenthal in the English version. The latter also voiced teen Ben Tennyson in Ben 10, Suzaku Kururugi in Code Geass, Sun Ce in the Dynasty Warriors franchise, Simon in Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, Marth in Fire Emblem, and Spider-Man from the Insomniac universe.<a href="https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Sasuke_Uchiha"><br>Click here to know more about Sasuke Uchiha</h3></a></label>

She initially has an infatuation for Sasuke, him at every juncture, and initially is not ambitious, besides becoming Sasuke's girlfriend in the future; by contrast, she is dismissive to her less-skilled teammate Naruto Uzumaki despite, ironically, being Naruto's initial love interest and disgust him. Over the course of the series, as Sasuke eventually leaves the village, Sakura begins to shed this singularly driven persona, becoming a medical ninja while apprenticed under the Fifth Hokage, Tsunade, and becomes friendly and even protective of Naruto as his life becomes increasingly at risk.
Sakura serves as the series' female lead, although she was not immediately intended for the role. Kishimoto had difficulty drawing her character, resulting in Kishimoto inadvertently emphasizing certain parts of her appearance, including her large forehead which was written into her character. In order to make the character more appealing in the second part of the series, Kishimoto designed her costume in a way that makes her look more like a martial artist as well as more beautiful during later chapters. Chie Nakamura voices the character in the animated adaptations of the series, while Kate Higgins plays her in the English dub.<a href="https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Sakura_Haruno"><br>Click here to know more about Sakura Haruno</h3></label>
